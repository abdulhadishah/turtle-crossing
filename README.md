# 🐢 Turtle Crossing

A Frogger-style crossing game built using Python Turtle Graphics. The player controls a turtle that must safely cross a busy road while avoiding moving cars that increase in speed with each level.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Python`
- `Turtle Graphics`
- `Time`

## 🚀 Features

- Player-controlled turtle movement
- Randomly generated cars moving across the screen
- Level progression with increasing difficulty
- Score and level tracking
- Game-over state on collision

## 📍 The Process

This project was built as **Day 23 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course and builds on concepts learned in previous projects. The focus was on managing multiple moving objects, detecting collisions, and progressively increasing difficulty.

The player moves the turtle upward toward the finish line. Each successful crossing increases the level, resets the turtle’s position, and speeds up the cars. Cars are generated off-screen and move continuously, while collisions with the turtle immediately end the game.

## 🚦 Running the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the main file: `python main.py`  
3. Use the `↑` arrow key to move the turtle  
4. Avoid cars and reach the top to level up  
5. Click anywhere to exit after game over
